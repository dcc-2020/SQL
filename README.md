# SQL_Challenge

The origional csv files were indepedent data but there were some data relation between one and another. An ERD was set up first to determine the relationship of each files. This helps provide a better visual and makes it more clear when connecting the tables.

Each csv files were created into a table on SQL so sorting can be done on the datas. As for the extra part, all the tables in sql were loaded into python through the use of sqlalchemy. When loaded into python, extra analysis can be done on the data such as finding the average salary of each position. It could also be drawn into graphs for a better visualization.
